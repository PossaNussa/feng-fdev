# kudzu
kudzu mod for minetest, with useful crafts and items

Kudzu plants attempt to spread around the world covering everything in it if left alone, but slowly.

Biomes can be enabled in settings (enable_kudzu_biome). Is disabled by default due to spreading effect.

Kudzu can be made craftable in settings (enable_kudzu_craft). Is disabled by default due to potential for griefing.

Adds kudzu sticks, kudzu ladders, and food items (tea, soup, jelly).
