Name:     castle
Source:   Fork of upstream mods - Do not replace
License:  See notes below

----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. This  version of "castle" is a single unified "castle" mod descend-
ed from the "castle" modpack  in the  "minetest-mods" trollstream col-
lection as it was circa 2020.

That modpack was was descended from Castles Mod by Philipbenr and Dan-
Duncombe.  So, this version of "castle" is a mod descended from a mod-
pack that's descended from a mod.

3. Pros and cons of this fork:

*. This mod is intended  for use with Bucket Game and derivatives.  It
won't work with other MT "_games" without changes.

* It's  easier  to work with this (mod) version than with the  modpack
version. As a related note, the original (ancestral) mod was split in-
to a modpack prematurely.

* This version of  "castle" no longer conflicts  (or usually shouldn't
conflict) with external "anvil", "rope", and/or "ropes" mods.

* The various "castle_...:" namespaces have been  merged into a single
"castle:" namespace.

* An attempt has been  made to tidy up conversions of nodes from other
versions of the mod. This version should support more maps in general.
However, some conversions are missing or omitted.

* The  world host can use a  "world.conf" setting to enable or disable
"castle". The mod is enabled by default. To disable it, use:

disable_castle = true

* Most  "castle"  materials and shapes  are disabled by default.  This
means  that a world host needs to explicitly  enable the parts that he
or she wants. For example:

castle_masonry_murderhole     = true
castle_masonry_pillar         = true
castle_masonry_sandstonebrick = true
castle_masonry_stonewall      = true

At the same time, this reduces  the  share of  nodespace that  the mod
takes by default. Note that nodespace is a limited resource.

* Two significant changes were made to "castles" in Fall 2022:

      (a) A crash was fixed
      (b) Support for old types of castle tapestries was added
