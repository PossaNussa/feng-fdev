## Bugfix v1.0 -> v1.1

It appeared in v1.0, that the mod would "error" because it couldn't access mcl_chests... which is correct if not in VL gamemode.

Unfortunately, the mod would error when in MTG... which doesn't have mcl_chests, which is correct... but should continue because it's not needed.
