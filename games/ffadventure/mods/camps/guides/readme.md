# Camps Guide

This assumes you have some familiarity with gathering resources, and crafting.

> It also assumes the Camps mod has crafting enabled `camps.craft = true` in you're settings (This is default)

You will need a good amount of:

- Diamonds (You'll need around 1 block and 9 separate diamonds)
- Gold (You'll need around 5 blocks and 8 separate gold ingots)
- Iron/Steel (You'll need around 5 blocks and 8 separate iron/steel ingots)
- Chests (You'll need around 8 chests)

Now here's where it varies, depending on you're "game":

- [Minetest Game](mtg/readme.md)
- [VoxeLibre](vl/readme.md)

> Oops, did I say it varies... Nope, the materials were selected to be cross-game supported (This way: iron is iron, and gold is gold), their crafting recipes are all the same.
