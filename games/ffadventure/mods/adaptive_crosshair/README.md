Crosshair adapts depending on what the player is wielding and looking at.

## Features:

- show if looked thing is interactable.
- show if wielded thing can be consumed or used.
- show if wielded thing can be placed.
- show if wielded thing is the correct tool to use depending on what is being looked at.
  - green: correct tool being used.
  - red: wrong tool being used.

## Limitations:

Though an item/tool may have a "use" function the crosshair may or may
not show this.
