#### WayStone is a simple mod that I made inspired by another mod, which I made as one of my learning challenges.
#### The mod worked very well for me and is available for anyone who wants to use it in their world, and how to use this mod?
---


#### 1 - First create your Waystone.

<span style="color: green">


[ Group Stone ] [ Group Stone ] [ Group Stone ]


[ Group Stone ] [ Astral ] [ Group Stone ]


[ Group Stone ] [ Group Stone ] [ Group Stone ]


</span>

 #### 2 - Now create a scroll.

<span style="color: green">

[ Group Stick ] [ Paper] [ Group Stick ]

[ Group Stick ] [ Astral ] [ Group Stick ]

[ Group Stick ] [ Paper ] [ Group Stick ]

</span>

#### 3 - Click on the Waystone holding the scroll to mark the position.


#### 4 - To return, simply use the scroll, it will be consumed and you will return to the marked position.


#### 5 - In addition to the standard scroll, there are 3 more with different colors so that you do not get confused.
