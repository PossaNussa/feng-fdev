Expanded armors for the 3D Armors Minetest mod.

Currently, it introduces 2 early game armors: Woven Armor and Leather Armor. You can enable or disable any armor you want as it's structured like a modpack! More armors may be added in the future.

## Woven Armor
Especially useful if you don't want to play with wooden/cactus armor, it's a great starter armor to give you *some* protection.

To craft, use the normal armor crafting recipe with anything belonging to `group:grass` (basically most default MTG grass will work).

| Piece     | Durability| Level | Heal |Damage Groups |
| --------- | --------- | ----- | ---- | ------------- |
| Helmet    | 26 Hits   | 3     | 0    | cracky=3, snappy=2, choppy=3, crumbly=2 |
| Chestplate| 26 Hits   | 8     | 0    | cracky=3, snappy=2, choppy=3, crumbly=2 |
| Leggings  | 26 Hits   | 8     | 0    | cracky=3, snappy=2, choppy=3, crumbly=2 |
| Boots     | 26 Hits   | 3     | 0    | cracky=3, snappy=2, choppy=3, crumbly=2 |

## Leather Armor
Good upgrade after Woven, Wooden or Cactus armor. Same durability as Steel armor but slightly worse in level, great for when you haven't found steel yet or for above-ground adventurers who don't mine.

To craft, use the normal armor crafting recipe with `group:leather` ("leather" items, accessible through [mobs redo](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/mobs/) mods or [Animalia](https://content.minetest.net/packages/ElCeejo/animalia/)).

| Piece     | Durability| Level | Heal |Damage Groups |
| --------- | --------- | ----- | ---- | ------------- |
| Helmet    | 82 Hits   | 7     | 0    | cracky=3, snappy=2, choppy=2, crumbly=2 |
| Chestplate| 82 Hits   | 12    | 0    | cracky=3, snappy=2, choppy=2, crumbly=2 |
| Leggings  | 82 Hits   | 12    | 0    | cracky=3, snappy=2, choppy=2, crumbly=2 |
| Boots     | 82 Hits   | 7     | 0    | cracky=3, snappy=2, choppy=2, crumbly=2 |
