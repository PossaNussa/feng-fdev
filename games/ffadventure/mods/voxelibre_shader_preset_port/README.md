# VoxeLibre Shader Preset Port
This is a tiny mod that ports VoxeLibre's shaders to any game in Minetest. Ideally enjoyed with all shader effects enabled.

Credits to [R0lleroxa](https://content.luanti.org/packages/ROllerozxa/volumetric_lighting/) for the code that shows how this works. (I may look at it if I decide to make the parameters customizable in-game) ^w^

## Todo (no promises.)

- [ ] Add customizable parameters

**Note: You can just edit `init.lua` to change the parameters for now.**
