Astralcraft
===========

Harness the power of the stars with Astralcraft! Astralcraft adds shooting stars to your world which can be used to access unique forms of movement and utility.

Shooting Stars
--------------

Largely inspired by [fallen stars in Terraria](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Fallen_Star), Astralcraft will cause the night sky to shower your world with shooting stars. These stars can be collected and broken down into star fragments which are useful for crafting star-related items. But beware that any stars not collected during the night will vanish at sunrise!

Warp Stars
----------

A warp star can be crafted with four mese crystal fragments and a shooting star in a 'plus' pattern. Warp stars can be thrown and will teleport you to wherever the warp star lands, similar to [Ender Pearls in Minecraft](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ender_Pearl). Warp stars deplete with use but can be recharged with mese crystal fragments.

The amount of wear that a warp star incurs is proportional to the distance that it teleports you; the further it teleports you, the more wear it will incur. If the warp star is thrown out-of-bounds, into an unloaded area, or if it stays airborne for too long (six seconds by default), then it will incur a large wear penalty and return to the location it was thrown from.

Beware that warp stars do not provide any form of fall damage protection, so if it is thrown against a wall or ceiling high above the ground, you may fall from dangerously high up in the air!

Astralite
---------

Astralite is a special node crafted with four star fragments in a square pattern that allows you to make great leaps when standing on it. These giant leaps can be used to traverse chaotic terrain such as sky islands, cliffs, shattered mountains, and spacious caverns.

While standing on astralite, a cloud of particles at your feet will indicate that jumping will launch you high into the air. Astralite will grant you fall damage immunity while leaping, so feel free to make ambitious jumps with little fear of falling!

You can also craft with star fragments in common shapes to create astralite stairs, slabs, and walls which all function the same as astralite blocks.

Star Armor
----------

Star fragments can be crafted in the familiar armor patterns to create star armor. This special armor provides slightly less armor than metal armors in most situations, but it gains a large boost to the protection it gives while exposed to moonlight. Star armor also emits light for each piece of armor equipped which makes it great for traveling at night or mining in dark caves ([Wielded Light](https://content.luanti.org/packages/bell07/wielded_light/) required).

However, star armor is also fairly fragile and will break more easily than other armors, so be mindful of how much damage you take whlie wearing it!

Star Charm
----------

A star charm is a simple equippable accessory that can be crafted from a steel ingot and three star fragments in a 'diamond' pattern. Any player with a star charm equipped will see additional shooting stars at night. This is very useful for gathering additional stars for crafting!
